# JSON-LD Management Service

Introduction
The JSON-LD Management Service is a powerful and extensible backend system designed to:

Dynamically manage JSON-LD schemas.
Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across multiple collections.
Seamlessly integrate with external APIs to fetch, validate, and expand JSON-LD schemas.
Enforce schema validation, versioning, and conflict resolution.
Provide observability through structured logging and metrics for real-time insights.
Built using FastAPI, this service is modular, scalable, and optimized for modern data-driven applications.

Key Features
Dynamic CRUD Operations:
Handles multiple collections and schemas dynamically.
Includes intelligent schema validation using JSON Schema.

JSON-LD Schema Management:
Supports schema creation, validation, and expansion.
Enables schema versioning and governance for tracking changes.

External API Integration:
Fetches and integrates data from external APIs.
Dynamically maps external fields to existing schemas.

Observability:
Built-in structured logging for all operations.
Prometheus metrics for monitoring performance and usage.

Error Handling:
Centralized exception handling with meaningful responses.
Graceful fallback for missing or invalid data.

Scalability:
Designed for modular extensions and seamless integration into larger systems.

Architecture Overview
Technologies Used
Backend Framework: FastAPI
Database: MongoDB (for schema storage and operations)
External Integrations: HTTP APIs (via requests)
Validation: JSON Schema
Metrics: Prometheus (for performance tracking)
Logging: Pythonâ€™s logging module with structured outputs

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

Python 3.10 or later
pip (Python package manager)
MongoDB
Redis (optional for caching external API data)
